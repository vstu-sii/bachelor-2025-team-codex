Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) explains limits of working memory.
Intrinsic load is tied to task complexity; extraneous load comes from poor instructional design.
Segmenting content and using dual‑coding (text + visuals) can improve learning outcomes.
Spaced repetition strengthens long‑term retention by revisiting material over increasing intervals.
